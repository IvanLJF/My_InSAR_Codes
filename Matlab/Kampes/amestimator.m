% Dealing with velocity (or height-error) increments along arcs in the TIN
% outliers will be detected out and removed by means of AM etimator 
% (i.e., iterative least squares approach), as well as the abosolute
% linear velocities or height errors at PS points will be computed.

% Initialize and form observation and constant matrix
% Note: There is one observation equation for each arc, like v(i)-v(j)=dv.
%           Suppose that the absolute velocity at the first PS point is
%           known as zero. The total number of observation eaquations 
%           will be num_Arcs, while total number of unknowns will be num_PS-1.
%           Therefore each equation might contain 1 or 2  non-zero entries.
%           It means that there are num_PS-2 or num_PS-3 zero entries in each 
%           observation equation. That is why the observation matrix is a sparse one.
